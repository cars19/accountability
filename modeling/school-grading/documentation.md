## A-F School Grading Model

This page outlines our final model for A-F school grading.

First, identify F Schools which are 5 percent of lowest performing schools based on a three year success rate without a Level 4 or 5 school composite TVAAS in each of the two most recent years AND schools with a graduation rate below 67 percent.

### Achievement Score

Next, assess schools based on the following indicators based on All Students performance:

|   | Achievement (% O/M) | TVAAS | Ready Graduate | Opportunity to Learn | ELPA |
|---|---------------------|-------|----------------|----------------------|------|
| A | Top Quintile Success Rate OR 12.5% Growth | Level 5 | [50, 100] OR 12.5% Growth | [0, 8) OR 12.5% Reduction in Chronic Absence | [36, 100] Percent Exit OR [70, 100] Meet Growth Standard |
| B | 2nd Quintile Success Rate OR 6.25% Growth | Level 4 | (35, 50) OR 6.25% Growth | [8, 12] OR 6.25% Reduction in Chronic Absence | [24, 36) Percent Exit OR [60, 70) Meet Growth Standard |
| C | 3rd Quintile Success Rate OR 6.25% Growth with Upper Bound CI | Level 3 | (28, 35] OR Greater than Prior Year | (12, 17] OR 6.25% Reduction in Chronic Absence with Lower Bound CI | [12, 24) Percent Exit OR [45, 60) Meet Growth Standard |
| D | 4th Quintile Success Rate OR Less than 6.25% Growth with Upper Bound CI | Level 2 | (15, 30) OR Same as Prior Year | (17, 24] OR Less than 6.25% Reduction in Chronic Absence with Lower Bound CI | [6, 12) Percent Exit OR [30, 45) Meet Growth Standard |
| F | Bottom Quintile Success Rate OR Upper Bound CI <= Prior Year % P/A | Level 1 | [0, 15] OR Less than Prior Year | (24, 100] OR Lower Bound CI >= Prior Year Chronic Absence | [0, 6) Percent Exit OR [0, 30) Meet Growth Standard |

A school receives a grade corresponding to the highest condition met for each indicator. For instance, a school with a success rate at the 50th percentile but which shows 12.5% growth from the prior year receives an A grade for Achievement. Schools only receive a grade for Achievement, Readiness, ELPA and Absenteeism if they can be evaluated for both the absolute and AMO components.

ELPA exit is weighted by time in ESL services.

For K-8 schools, indicators are weighted as follows: 45% Achievement, 35% Growth, 10% Opportunity to Learn, 10% ELPA. If a school does not meet a minimum n count for ELPA, the indicators are weighted as follows: 50% Achievement, 40% Growth, 10% Opportunity to Learn.

For high schools, indicators are weighted as follows: 30% Achievement, 25% Growth, 25% Ready Graduate, 10% Opportunity to Learn, 10% ELPA. If a school does not meet a minimum n count for ELPA, the indicators are weighted as follows: 35% Achievement, 30% Growth, 25% Ready Graduate, 10% Opportunity to Learn.

A school receive an overall Achievement score based on the weighted average of its achievement indicators, where grades map to numerical values as follows: A = 4, B = 3, C = 2, D = 1, F = 0.

### Gap Score

Next, assess schools based on the following indicators based on subgroup performance:

|   | Achievement | Growth | Ready Graduate | Opportunity to Learn | ELPA |
|---|-------------|--------|----------------|----------------------|------|
| A | Top Quintile Success Rate OR 12.5% Growth | Top Quintile in Moving Students to Higher Proficiency Band | [50, 100] OR 12.5% Growth | [0, 8) OR 12.5% Reduction in Chronic Absence | [36, 100] Percent Exit OR [70, 100] Meet Growth Standard |
| B | 2nd Quintile Success Rate OR 6.25% Growth | 2nd Quintile in Moving Students to Higher Proficiency Band | (35, 50) OR 6.25% Growth | [8, 12] OR 6.25% Reduction in Chronic Absence | [24, 36) Percent Exit OR [60, 70) Meet Growth Standard |
| C | 3rd Quintile Success Rate OR 6.25% Growth with Upper Bound CI | 3rd Quintile in Moving Students to Higher Proficiency Band | (28, 35] OR Greater than Prior Year | (12, 17] OR 6.25% Reduction in Chronic Absence with Lower Bound CI | [12, 24) Percent Exit OR [45, 60) Meet Growth Standard |
| D | 4th Quintile Success Rate OR Less than 6.25% Growth with Upper Bound CI | 4th Quintile in Moving Students to Higher Proficiency Band | (16, 28] OR Same as Prior Year | (17, 24] OR Less than 6.25% Reduction in Chronic Absence with Lower Bound CI | [6, 12) Percent Exit OR [30, 45) Meet Growth Standard |
| F | Bottom Quintile Success Rate OR Upper Bound CI <= Prior Year % P/A | Bottom Quintile in Moving Students to Higher Proficiency Band | [0, 16] OR Less than Prior Year | (24, 100] OR Lower Bound CI >= Prior Year Chronic Absence | [0, 6) Percent Exit OR [0, 30) Meet Growth Standard |

For K-8 schools, indicators are weighted as follows: 45% Achievement, 35% Growth, 10% Opportunity to Learn, 10% ELPA. If a school does not meet a minimum n count for ELPA, the indicators are weighted as follows: 50% Achievement, 40% Growth, 10% Opportunity to Learn.

For high schools, indicators are weighted as follows: 30% Achievement, 25% Growth, 25% Ready Graduate, 10% Opportunity to Learn, 10% ELPA. If a school does not meet a minimum n count for ELPA, the indicators are weighted as follows: 35% Achievement, 30% Growth, 25% Ready Graduate, 10% Opportunity to Learn.

Each subgroup receives a score based on the weighted average of its indicators, where grades map to numerical values as follows: A = 4, B = 3, C = 2, D = 1, F = 0. A school's subgroup grades are averaged again, weighted by the total weight represented by the subgroup grade, to produce an overall subgroup score.

A school's overall achievement and subgroup scores are weighted (60% achievement, 40% subgroup) and averaged to produce an overall average. The overall average maps to a final grade as follows:

+ (3, 4] = A
+ (2, 3] = B
+ (1, 2] = C
+ [0, 1] = D
+ Bottom 5% + Grad Rate Below 67% = F
