## accountability

Code for reporting state, district, and school-level assessment results, both with (numeric/accountability files) and without (base/assessment files) accountability rules applied, as well as AMO targets, and non-assessment indicators used in accountability such as absenteeism, graduation rate, ACT, and ELPA. Files suppressed under FERPA rules are available for public download on the [Tennnessee Department of Education](https://www.tn.gov/education/data/data-downloads.html) website.

This repository also contains code for producing district accountability designations. These designations are [publicly available](https://www.tn.gov/education/data/accountability.html).
